# Telecom_Customer_Churn

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is essential for businesses to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

### Introduction
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is the process by which customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses, especially in highly competitive industries like telecommunications. This project uses machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical data.

### Model RF and DT
In the context of predicting telecom customer churn, decision trees and random forest classifiers serve as powerful tools to analyze and forecast customer behavior. A decision tree classifier operates by recursively partitioning the data based on the most influential features, creating a tree-like structure of decision rules. This enables the identification of patterns leading to churn, providing insights into the key factors influencing customer attrition. On the other hand, the random forest classifier, an ensemble of decision trees, combines the strengths of multiple trees to enhance predictive accuracy and generalization. By aggregating the predictions of individual trees, random forests offer robust performance, mitigating overfitting and improving the model's ability to capture complex relationships within the telecom customer data. The interpretability of decision trees and the predictive power of random forests make them valuable tools in understanding and addressing telecom customer churn, assisting businesses in proactively retaining customers, and optimizing their strategies for customer satisfaction.

#### SMOTE
SMOTE stands for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, and it is a technique used to address class imbalance in classification problems.In many real-world datasets, one class (usually the minority class) might be underrepresented compared to the other class(es). This class imbalance can lead machine learning models to perform poorly, as they may become biased towards the majority class. SMOTE is one of the methods to tackle this issue.

### PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. Its primary goal is to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much of the original variability as possible. PCA achieves this by identifying the principal components, which are the directions in which the data varies the most.

### Streamlit Webapp
Deploying a Telecom Customer Churn model using Streamlit involves creating an interactive web application to showcase the model's predictions. Below is a simplified guide to deploying a machine learning model using Streamlit. Note that this is a basic example, and in a production setting, you may need to consider additional security measures and scalability.
